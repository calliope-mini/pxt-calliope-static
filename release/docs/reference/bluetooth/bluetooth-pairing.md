For another device like a smartphone to use any of the Bluetooth "services" which the @boardname@ has, it must first be paired with the @boardname@. Once paired, the other device may connect to the @boardname@ and exchange data relating to many of the @boardname@'s features.

Follow the [Bluetooth Pairing Guide](https://microbit.org/guide/mobile/) to pair your @boardname@ to your computer or phone.
