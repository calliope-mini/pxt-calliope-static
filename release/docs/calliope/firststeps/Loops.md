# FIRST STEPS: LOOPS

## Introduction @unplugged

As you may have noticed in previous exercises, your program was executed only once by Calliope mini. To change this, you can use loops. Use an infinite loop so that the text runs over the LED grid of your Calliope mini infinitely often.

### Infinite loop
The simplest way is to use a foverever block, from the basic section.
Everything inside will be repeated forever.

## Step 2 @fullscreen

Of course, you can also specify how often something should be repeated:

### Repeat block
Use the „on start“ block or any other block that usually initiates a one time cycle. Take the "Repeat 4 times" block from the Loops section and enter the desired number in the number field. Whatever task is within this block will be executed for the number of times you entered within the “Repeat …“ number.
