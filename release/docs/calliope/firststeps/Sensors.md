### Displaying sensor data
In order to display data from your sensors on the Calliope mini’s LED matrix, you need to select a sensor (value). To do so go to the Basic section and select the "show number 0“ block. Within the number you can now change the "0“ to the value of a sensor.

## Step 2 @fullscreen

### Acceleration sensor
You can select the acceleration values by dragging the block from the Input section and place it on top of the "0“ (which will disappear).

## Step 3 @fullscreen

### Light sensor
The light is measured by the LED matrix. You can select the light sensor by dragging the block from the Input section into the number block.

## Step 4 @fullscreen

### Compass
The built in magnetometer allows the Calliope mini to tell in which direction it is facing. This sensor will provide a value between 0 and 360 degrees. The compass will need to be calibrated before use. Follow the instructions on the Calliope mini and tilt it in a circular fashion to display a complete circle. You can start using it by dragging the block from the Input section into the number block.
