# First Steps

## Introduction @unplugged

### 1) Connecting

Connect your mini to your computer via a micro USB cable or Bluetooth. Macs, PCs, Chromebooks, Linux systems, Smartphones and Tablets are supported.

Your Calliope mini will show up on your computer as a drive called 'MINI'.

Open your favourite browser and head to our website and select Editor in the main navigation.

For example drag and drop some blocks and try your program on the Simulator within the editor.

Click the Download button in the editor. This will download a 'hex' file, which is a compact format of your program that your mini can read. Once the file has been downloaded, just copy it to your Calliope mini just like copying a file to a USB stick.

### 2) Power it Up

The Calliope mini requires a power source to work. You can either connect your Calliope mini directly to a computer using a Micro USB cable or you can power it using a battery pack.
Here are the instructions on how to connect the battery pack to your Calliope mini:

The supplied battery pack requires two AAA batteries.

Carefully insert the small white plastic connector from the battery pack into the board’s battery socket.

Be careful to insure that the ridge on the plug is facing upwards.

If the plug slides easily into the socket then you are attaching it correctly. Otherwise, turn the plug round and re-insert it into the socket. Slide it to "on“ and your Calliope mini is powered by the batteries.
